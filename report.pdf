# **Final Project Report: Binance Futures Order Bot**

**Student Name:** Hemasree

**Project Name:** CLI-based Trading Bot for Binance USDT-M Futures

**Environment:** Binance Futures Testnet

**Submission Date:** December 30, 2025

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

The **Binance Futures Order Bot** is a high-performance Command Line Interface (CLI) tool developed to automate trading on the Binance USDT-M Futures platform. The project demonstrates a full-stack approach to algorithmic trading, covering secure API integration, robust error handling, and the implementation of advanced trading strategies like OCO and TWAP.

## **2. System Architecture and Security**

To meet professional standards and project requirements, the bot follows a modular architecture:

* **Security Configuration**: All sensitive credentials are removed from the source code and stored in a local `.env` file.
* **Credential Protection**: A `.gitignore` file is utilized to ensure that the `.env` file is never uploaded to public repositories like GitHub, preventing unauthorized access to trading funds.
* **Environment Setup**: For evaluation purposes, the bot is configured to run on the **Binance Futures Testnet**, allowing for risk-free testing of all functionalities.

## **3. Core Order Implementation (50% Evaluation)**

The bot successfully implements mandatory order types with built-in validation:

* **Market Orders**: Executes immediate buy or sell actions at the current market price.
* **Limit Orders**: Places orders at specific price targets to optimize entry and exit points.
* **Input Validation**: Before any order is transmitted, the bot validates the trading symbol (e.g., BTCUSDT), the quantity, and the price against Binance's minimum requirements.

## **4. Advanced Trading Strategies (30% Evaluation)**

Beyond basic functionality, the bot includes sophisticated trading logic for competitive evaluation:

* **OCO (One-Cancels-the-Other)**: A strategy that places a take-profit and a stop-loss simultaneously. If one is triggered, the other is automatically cancelled.
* **TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)**: Automatically splits a large order into smaller chunks executed over a defined time period to reduce market impact and slippage.
* **Grid Trading**: Automates the process of buying low and selling high within a specific price range.

## **5. Logging and Error Management (10% Evaluation)**

The bot features a structured logging system through a global `bot.log` file:

* **Timestamped Records**: Every action, from initialization to order execution, is logged with the exact time of occurrence.
* **Error Troubleshooting**: During development, a persistent **`-2015` error** was encountered. This was identified as a timestamp synchronization issue and a permission mismatch, which was resolved by performing a Windows system clock sync and transitioning to the Futures-specific Testnet.
* **Error Traces**: Detailed stack traces for API errors are captured to assist in rapid debugging.

## **6. Historical Data Analysis**

Using the provided `historical_data.csv`, the bot’s strategies were verified against real-world market movements:

* **Backtesting**: The TWAP and Grid strategies were "simulated" against the price data in the CSV to confirm mathematical accuracy.
* **PnL Analysis**: Calculated cumulative profit and loss metrics based on the `Closed PnL` data within the dataset to verify strategy performance.

## **7. Reproducibility for Evaluators**

To reproduce the results of this bot, evaluators must:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Access the project from the private GitHub link provided.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Add Personal Credentials**: Create a new `.env` file in the root directory and add your own Binance Testnet keys:
```text
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_testnet_key
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_testnet_secret

```


4. **Execute Commands**: Use CLI commands such as `python src/market_orders.py BTCUSDT BUY 0.01`.
